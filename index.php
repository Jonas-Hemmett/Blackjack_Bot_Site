                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to combine my interest in card games with computer science to create a more efficient playstyle. I was also interested in the practical applications of AI and this was a good opportunity to use it. I started this project in CS 2210: Computer Organization and I've continued to expand it independently using concepts from CS 3240: Algorithm Design & Analysis and CS 2510: Intro Artificial Intelligence. <br>
                    <br>

                    The bot itself is designed solely for entertainment, I play cards with my friends fairly frequently so it's always fun when the blackjack bot gets to make an appearance.

                <p>
                    I’m currently a Computer Science major at the University of Vermont. I love creative problem solving and exploring how technology can bring my ideas to life. I enjoy building projects that combine code, CAD, and hands-on experimentation to create practical and creative solutions.<br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of school, I always try to stay busy. I like skiing, leatherworking & fashion design, and playing games, whether they be video, card, or board.
